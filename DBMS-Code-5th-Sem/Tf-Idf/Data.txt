modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. 
Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration
 of user accounts. Many edits can be made in real-time and appear almost instantly 
 online, but this feature facilitates abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require 
 user authentication to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. Maged N. Kamel Boulos,
  Cito Maramba, and Steve Wheeler write that the open wikis produce a process of Social 
  Darwinism. 'Unfit' sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited, and replaced 
  if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher 
  quality and more relevant page. While such openness may invite 'vandalism' and the posting 
  of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correction or 
  connectfulness restoring a 'quality' wiki
