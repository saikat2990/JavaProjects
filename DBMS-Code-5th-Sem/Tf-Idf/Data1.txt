Suppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to rank which document is most 
relevant to the query, "the brown cow". A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents 
that do not contain all three words "the", "brown", and "cow", but this still leaves many 
documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs 
in each document; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term frequency. 
However, in the case where the length of documents varies greatly, adjustments are often made 
(see definition below). The first form of term weighting is due to Hans Peter Luhn (1957) 
which may be summarized as:
The weight of a term that occurs in a document is simply proportional to the term frequency
